### Week 11 Achievements:

* Full-Cycle Development: Successfully managed the entire deployment lifecycle of a complex 3-Tier Web Application:

  * Integrated networking, compute, and database layers.

* Advanced IaC Integration: Created a master CloudFormation template:

  * Seamlessly orchestrated the deployment of the entire infrastructure stack.

  * Confirmed deployment of networking, compute (ALB, ASG), database (RDS), and necessary IAM permissions.

* Performance Tuning: Executed optimization steps:

  * Fine-tuned Security Group rules and verified resource usage.

  * Ensured the application met defined performance metrics within budget constraints.

* Professional Documentation: Produced a high-quality technical documentation package:

  * Included an architecture diagram, detailed CFN template explanation, and a deployment runbook.
