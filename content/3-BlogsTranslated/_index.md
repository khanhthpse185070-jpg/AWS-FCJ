This section will list and introduce the blogs you have translated. For example:

###  [Blog 1 - Build a scalable AI assistant to help refugees using AWS ](3.1-Blog1/)
The article details the technical implementation of Victor, a scalable, multilingual generative AI assistant developed by the Danish humanitarian organization Bevar Ukraine using AWS services. Victor is designed to help Ukrainian refugees integrate into Danish society by providing automated assistance with public services, job searching, and legal procedures, overcoming common challenges like scalability and language barriers faced by traditional human support systems. Victor successfully serves hundreds of refugees daily, saving Bevar Ukraine volunteers thousands of hours, and providing refugees with instant, high-quality answers to urgent questions about life in Denmark.

###  [Blog 2 - Agents as escalators: Real-time AI video monitoring with Amazon Bedrock Agents and video streams](3.2-Blog2/)
The AWS blog post "Agents as Escalators" introduces a solution for real-time AI video monitoring using Amazon Bedrock Agents and video streams, aiming to reduce alert fatigue and improve contextual event understanding.

Core Problem: Traditional video monitoring systems rely on simple rules, leading to excessive false positives, limited contextual awareness (cannot distinguish normal vs. suspicious behavior), and a lack of semantic memory (cannot learn from historical patterns).
